# el-proyecte-grande-sprint-1-java-bettitaksas

This project aims to develop an application capable of tracking the contents of a user's fridge(kitchen),
and recommends recipes based on them, prioritizing using up ingredients that are about to go stale or spoil.

For the first sprint we intend to setup the base MVC architecture that we can easily expand during later sprints.

For the second sprint we will setup a proper database using JPA as well as improve already existing features e.g. better recipe recommendation algorithm
